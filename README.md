### Movie Project
This version uses React, Redux, Express, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).


### Description

**My Flix**
My Flix is an application that will allow a user to interact with movies' website. Upon arriving at the sight there is a list of movies with different genres to select from. 
The user can click on a movie poster and will be directed to a details page where they can read the description of the movie in it's entirety and if they so desire can click on the Edit button that directs them to an Edit page where they can edit the Title, Genre and/ or description of the selected movie, or a back to List button that will return them to the homepage.
The submit button on the Edit page takes the user back to the details page with the updated title and description. From there the user can then navigate back to homepage which also would have been updated with their new title, genre and description.
